<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes when you talk to new people and share your desires to find common ground, there are some who are surprised when I inform them that <strong>I like meteorology</strong> and that I have <strong>2 weather stations in my home</strong> and several thermometers, most of them will also confirm with me that they have one small weather station or barometer they got from their grandfather.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, they ask me why do you like meteorology? Why are you interested in knowing the current time? It's certainly not easy to understand, but it's similar to an instinct that causes you to be aware about the weather and what it is likely to perform. Perhaps this is my beliefs, in the time we lived in caves and had just begun to walk upright and understand and interact with the physical world in a distinct way to other animals each social group of this primitive world was born with a degree of expertise in every subject such as a hunter with a high level of expertise who led the tribe in the hunt for prey, a healer, or shaman, who guided spiritually the tribe, a leader a handyman and why not an expert <strong>meteorologist</strong> who would combine his hobby or experience of <strong>meteorology</strong>with an additional profession, possibly together with the an shaman, in which the responsibilities of a physicist, chemist, doctor, and so on. were performed. In the present, and in all, <strong>of meteorology</strong> was nothing more than something mysterious and unfathomable in those times. This is to say this: <strong>that this "meteorologist" instinct</strong> is often acquired or developed by certain people and even though we're no meteorologists by any means, we love this area and are a source of information to our tiny tribes which surround us.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why is it important to pay attention to the forecast for weather?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are for me the primary reasons you must follow the weather forecast and why must have a weather station on your property even if you don't have a scientific interest in meteorology:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Planning your activities. Are you planning to take part in something? Do you know if it's going to rainand at what time, and if there's a chance of being cold? Perhaps some insight could allow you to optimize both your schedule and time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure you are wearing the right clothes. No one likes being cold, and it can ruin our day. Or, you can get wet because we didn't take the umbrella before getting up in the morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A better understanding of our limitations. By keeping track of the temperature and the weather, we learn to know the limits of our thermal capabilities and when we should bundle in more or take off our clothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- <strong>You can save money on cooling and heating.</strong>To many people it might seem like an absurdity but if you can learn how to control and understand the perfect temperature inside as well as how outside temperature affects the inside of your house I'm sure that you will be able to greatly maximize the energy use to control it. Also if you have the possibility of experiencing a sudden changes in the weather, you can implement preventive measures to make the most of. For instance: If you are aware that a colder weather system is coming, you can benefit from the favorable outdoor temperature prior to the cold wave to raise the temperature inside by using less power as it's not as cold. This way, when the cold hits, you've already warmed up the house. This does not mean that you will save much in the long run, but by implementing small adjustments you can make a huge difference over time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Talk with prudence on the subject of weather. Knowing how the meteorology of your location operates, you'll be able to talk with standards of how extreme your meteorology is.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">How to follow the meteorology and weather forecast in a straightforward manner?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In all of this, I would advise people to be more aware of the weather, and also have some kind of criterion to analyze of the weather data we receive each day, as sometimes I read and hear nonsense. In this regard, I'd like to suggest some things you can do to be up-to-date and cost very little time:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- <strong>You should have an at-home weather station</strong> , with thermometer, hygrometer and barometer at least, if it comes with an anemometer as well as a rain gauge then great. I leave you a link that has a number of good options:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <strong>Why should you have a weather station in your home?</strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the benefit of a weather station at your home is instant updates and localized information. We know precisely what the weather conditions are in our region and the forecast the station gives us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <strong>Check the time in several web pages ordered in order of importance:</strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">o Official website of the State Meteorological Agency. You will find the most precise information about the changes in the weather warnings for weather and half-time forecasts. It is the most reliable, credible and precise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">o You can also consult and compare the weather with other pages that may offer forecasts of longer-term weather but these forecasts can be quite challenging to be fulfilled and change quite often.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">What can you do to predict the possibility of short-term precipitation?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Storms, rain and snowfalls are among the things which we most worry about when planning our activities. In Spain If we wish to know whether it's likely to rain in the near period or if there is a possibility that a front with precipitation is moving towards our area, and how intense it is, I suggest that you check the AEMET radars where you will be able to see in great detail the development of precipitation within your area.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When is it better to check the weather forecast?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no specific time which is most reliable because the weather and forecast are constantly changing, and if I'm not in error, updates to the forecast for weather are released every 6 hours. I usually check it once I get up or leave my home in the morning before I leave work and in the evening to determine the next day's forecast.</p>
